# dealsFinder
Find deals cheapest - shortest by given jsonData.

The performance could be improved by using ReactJS to manage the DOM properly and delegating the calculations and heavy processes to the backend.

Nevertheless, the Graph.js and DealGraph.js libraries, calculates the cheapest/fastest deal by using the Dijkstra algorythm to find the shortest route between 2 nodes in a graph by setting the value to measure the distance between every node in the graph. In this case, COST/TIME (in minutes) are used to provide this parameter to solve the problem.

I created a logo and a short styleguide to follow in the implementation of the styles and colors.
